        <div>“Every Man for Himself (EMH)” is a web-based multiplayer game where 4-8 players are pitted against each other in order to escape a dungeon. One player is the “killer” and his objective is to eliminate the other players who are “prisoners.” The prisoners are trying to escape through a procedurally generated dungeon. The killer is attempting to eliminate the prisoners via the use of “traps” that he can place in the various dungeon rooms. The killer will be able to place different kinds of traps in each of the generated dungeon rooms. Every turn, all the prisoners must select a room to enter, and the killer will place a number of traps. If the chosen room is trapped, that prisoner will be killed. The prisoners will be able to pick up items that will counter certain traps, allowing them to proceed to the goal.</div>
